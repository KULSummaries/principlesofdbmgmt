This is a summary of the course ``Principles of Database Management'' (D0I62A), taught at the Catholic University of Leuven in the academic year 2015-2016. It is based on the lectures given by professor Baesens and Lemahieu, the online lectures\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdQddgMBv5zEhlpqdiUcf9aTNEtmESgyl}} and the quiz questions that were seen in class. Feel free to redistribute this to other people, but I ask you not to sell it.
